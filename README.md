# Large Language Models Starter Code

This repository contains starter code for working with Large Language Models (LLMs). It is designed to help data scientists and developers quickly bootstrap projects involving LLMs with a focus on ease of use, scalability, and best practices in machine learning and data analysis.


## Use cases
This repo shows how to run LLMs with the use of QLora,bitsandbytes, and also how to save and reload weights through HuggingFace. This repo also contains a docker file template that you can use to make the training of LLMs on multiple environments feasible.

## Acknowlegement

This code was heavily inspired by the notebook posted by Ibrahim Sobh - PhD on LinkedIn:
